### Questions 

* #### Efficiency in running the problem

  This can be seen as a 'Travelling Salesman Problem' within each cluster. TSP is also known as a operation research and NP-hard problem as well.
  
  The time complexity for my algorithm is O(n^2), which means the more inputs it get the time required to get an output expands quadratically.  
  
  In addition, the algoritm used utilises a greedy approach, which meant that it seeks to find the local minimum in the fastest time possible. This would make some of the routing to appear illogical as the algoritm seeks to find the shortest distance from the next delivery point based on the current point
  
  An improvement to the algorithm is to use Genetic algorithm instead where it computes all possible combinations and seeks to find the best combination by trying to find the cluster's global minimum 

* #### Any visualisation that you can think of
  
  We can visualise the output in Google map. The clusters and routes are exported in csv files and the data can be imported in to Google map and visulised.
  
  Google map file is attached in the repository. In addition, I will also share a link to view the map online. 
  
* #### Ideas on how you plan to scale this if the number of locations increase (more warehouses and distribution points). Also how this can be translated to engineering infrastructure if need be.

  Buildup areas (Business district or shopping centre) can adopt self collection model. This model is applicable for deliveries that are not time sensitive in nature.
  
  Warehouses/distribution points can be build based on inter-clusters centrality, which will optimise the coverage of the infrastructure to serve as many clusters as possible.
  
  Implementing a price tiering system will also be able to add new features in the route optimisation algorithm. This can be done by implementing a reward/penalty structure for the algorithm. The algorithm will learn from this and is able to plan routes geographically and the urgency of the delivery. 


* #### Problem statement is purposefully at a very high level. If you have any new ideas we didnâ€™t think of, would be a bonus.

  Assuming we are driving on the left side of the road:
  
  We can optimise the routes by placing priority on delivery points that are generally on the left side of road with respect to direction of travel. This saves time and effort for the deliveryman (parking, crossing the road and etc.). Delivery points located on the right side of the road can be planned for delivery when returning.
