# Administrative matter

### Viewing the notebook
The project is done entirely in Google Colab thus, is advisable to view it's entirety in Google Colab. 
Preview of the notebook on Github is not possible but downloading it to a local machine and viewing it on jupyter notebook is possible.

### Dataset generated
I have provided the datasets that have been generated when doing the model and routes.
Additionally, I have the datasets also stored in my own Google drive and you can bring up the dataset in the notebook as well. 
Appreciate if you can use the saver_function or save dataset sparingly because it will be saved into my Google drive folders.

### Visualisation
I have also provided a kmz file to visualise clusters and routes on google map
I will also provide a shareable link to the map so that you can view it online

#### Note: 
  * Cluster visualisation
    
    There is a limit to the number of colors Google map can assign to each cluster. Maximum is 20. So cluster 21 to 25 are         marked as unassigned. Apologies for that.
  
  * Interpretting the route
  
    The waypoints markers are marked with numbers in itselves and that denotes the order of the route.
    You can ignore the labels that are beside the markers
